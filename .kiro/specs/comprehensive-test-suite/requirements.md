# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive test cases for the PO to SO Agent Demo POC system. The system transforms Purchase Orders (PO) into Sales Orders (SO) through an agent-based architecture with validation, exception handling, and orchestration capabilities. The test suite must validate all core functionality, edge cases, error scenarios, and integration points to ensure system reliability and correctness.

## Glossary

- **PO_System**: The complete Purchase Order to Sales Order transformation system
- **Agent_Pipeline**: Sequential execution system for agent coordination
- **Agent_Coordinator**: Parallel execution system with dependency management
- **Orchestration_Manager**: Unified system managing both sequential and coordinated execution
- **Validation_Engine**: Component that validates orders against master SKU data
- **Exception_Handler**: Component that generates email notifications for invalid orders
- **Web_Dashboard**: Flask-based user interface for system monitoring
- **Test_Suite**: Comprehensive collection of automated tests covering all system features

4. WHEN agent dependencies are modified, THE Test_Suite SHALL validate that the orchestration system adapts correctly
5. WHEN maximum parallel agent limits are set, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that the system respects concurrency constraints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want error handling and recovery tests, so that I can ensure the system handles failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent fails during execution, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that the failure is detected and logged appropriately
2. WHEN a dependency agent fails, THE Test_Suite SHALL confirm that dependent agents are not executed
3. WHEN corrupted input data is provided, THE Test_Suite SHALL validate that agents handle errors without crashing the system
4. WHEN network or file system errors occur, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that appropriate error messages are generated
5. WHEN the system recovers from failures, THE Test_Suite SHALL confirm that subsequent executions work correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want data validation tests, so that I can ensure business rules are correctly implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN purchase orders contain invalid SKUs, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that validation exceptions are generated
2. WHEN price deviations exceed acceptable thresholds, THE Test_Suite SHALL confirm that orders are flagged as exceptions
3. WHEN quantity values are negative or zero, THE Test_Suite SHALL validate that appropriate validation errors occur
4. WHEN customer information is missing or invalid, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that orders are rejected with proper error messages
5. WHEN valid orders are processed, THE Test_Suite SHALL confirm that sales orders are generated with correct data transformation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want web dashboard tests, so that I can ensure the UI correctly displays system status and results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web dashboard loads, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that all navigation elements and pages render correctly
2. WHEN validation results are displayed, THE Test_Suite SHALL confirm that valid and exception orders are properly categorized
3. WHEN sales orders are shown, THE Test_Suite SHALL validate that data formatting and table display are accurate
4. WHEN exception emails are presented, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that error details and recipient information are correct
5. WHEN charts and visualizations load, THE Test_Suite SHALL confirm that data representation matches underlying results

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want load and performance tests, so that I can verify system behavior under various data volumes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing small datasets (1-10 orders), THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that execution completes within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN processing medium datasets (100-500 orders), THE Test_Suite SHALL confirm that memory usage remains within reasonable bounds
3. WHEN processing large datasets (1000+ orders), THE Test_Suite SHALL validate that the system maintains performance and stability
4. WHEN parallel execution is used, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that performance improvements are achieved compared to sequential execution
5. WHEN concurrent web dashboard access occurs, THE Test_Suite SHALL confirm that the UI remains responsive

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a configuration manager, I want configuration and setup tests, so that I can ensure the system works across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are missing, THE Test_Suite SHALL verify that default configurations are used appropriately
